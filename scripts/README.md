# Useful scripts

These are scripts that either I have made or that I found on the internet that are useful

## test-fonts.pl

pearl script to detect which fonts the given character exists in, if any. This was created to detect the fonts needed in the polybar config. 

### Usage

Make sure pearl compiler is installed

`pearl ./test-fonts.pl <CHARACTER YOU WANT TO DETECT>`

## autogit

Small javascript app which automatically does some git thing. Made it bc Im too lazy running the commands myself

### Usage

Make sure node is installed

`node ./index.js` starts the app. To actually run the autopush just run `fullpush <COMMIT MSG>`
